            <strong>1.Noise Pollution Monitoring:</strong> <br>
            <p><strong>Domain:</strong> National Ambient Noise Monitoring Network</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> IOT (Sensors), Firebase</p>
            <p><strong>Description</strong> Noise pollution monitoring involves the measurement and assessment of excessive or disruptive sounds in the environment. It typically includes the use of specialized equipment, such as sound level meters, to measure noise levels in decibels (dB) at various locations. Data collected can be analyzed to identify sources of noise pollution, assess its impact on health and the environment, and develop strategies for mitigation.</p><br>

            <strong>AI-Powered personalized learning roadmap generator</strong> <br>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong>Artificial intelligence, Machine learning</p>
            <p><strong>Description</strong> Is an Artificial i intelligent system that creates customized learning paths for individuals based on their current skills, goals, and preferences. It uses artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and recommendation algorithms to analyze user input and generate dynamic, goal-oriented roadmaps. These roadmaps adapt over time by monitoring user progress and performance, ensuring a more efficient and engaging learning experience. The system typically leverages technologies like Python (for AI/ML models), React or Angular (for frontend interfaces), Node.js or Django (for backend services), and cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud for scalability. By integrating with APIs from platforms like YouTube, Udemy, or Coursera, it can recommend the most relevant resources, helping users achieve their learning objectives faster and more effectively.</p><br>
